		<h1>Free and Open Source Software</h1>
		<h2>History and Origin</h2>
		<p>Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) refers to software that is freely available and can be used, modified, and distributed by anyone. The history of FOSS can be traced back to the early days of computing when software was shared freely and users were encouraged to modify and improve it.</p>

		<p>In the 1980s, Richard Stallman founded the Free Software Foundation and developed the GNU operating system, which is still widely used in FOSS today. The term "Open Source" was later coined in the 1990s by a group of software developers who wanted to emphasize the practical benefits of FOSS.</p>

				<p>Cost: FOSS is often available for free or at a lower cost than proprietary software, which can save businesses and individuals money.</p>

				<img src="https://coreaxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/flexible-work-options-post-ftimage.png" alt="Flexibility">
				<p>Flexibility:Open-source software is flexible in a way that allows developers to see how the code works and make changes to it. Therefore, they can adapt the software to their or their company's needs.
