        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) is a software development model
          that emerged in the 1980s. The idea behind FOSS is that software
          should be freely available, modifiable, and distributable to anyone.
          The "open source" in FOSS refers to the availability of the source code,
          which is the underlying programming instructions that make up the software.
          Open source software is characterized by the availability of the source code, 
          which can be freely modified,improved and distributed by anyone.
          This allows for greater transparency, collaboration and innovation in the development of software.
          The first notable example of FOSS is the GNU Project, started by
          Richard Stallman in 1983.

        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p>
          The origin of FOSS can be traced back to the hacker culture of the
          1960s and 1970s. Hackers were a group of computer enthusiasts who
          believed that software should be freely available and modifiable. They
          also valued sharing knowledge and collaborating with others. This
          culture laid the foundation for the development of FOSS.
          In the 1990s, the development of the Linux operating system, which was based on the GNU project's tools and utilities, 
          helped to popularize the concept of FOSS.Linux was developed by Linus Torvalds and other volunteers, who collaborated 
          online to create an open, community-driven operating system.

      <section id="advantages">
        <h2>Advantages</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cost savings</li>
          <li>Flexibility and customization</li>
          <li>Security</li>
          <li>Collaboration and innovation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          FOSS has several advantages over proprietary software. One of the
          biggest advantages is cost savings, since FOSS is often available for
          free. FOSS also allows for greater flexibility and customization,
          since anyone can modify the source code. FOSS is also generally
          considered to be more secure than proprietary software, since the
          source code can be reviewed by anyone. Finally, FOSS encourages
          collaboration and innovation, since anyone can contribute to the
          development of the software.Community support: FOSS is often supported 
          by a community of developers and users who work together to improve the software.
          This can result in better support and faster bug fixes than proprietary software, 
          where users are dependent on the vendor for support.
