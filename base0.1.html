    <p>FOSS stands for Free and Open Source Software. It refers to software that is both free to use and distribute and has the source code available for modification and improvement by anyone.</p>
    <h2>The Benefits of FOSS</h2>
    <ul>

      <li>Increased security and transparency</li>
      <li>Collaborative development and improvement</li>
